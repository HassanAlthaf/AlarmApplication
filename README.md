# AlarmApplication


This is a simple and easy to use alarm application programmed by me using Java. For the Graphical User Interface, 
I used JavaFX considering that Swing is now deprecated. This is very simple to see, you enter the hours, minutes and
seconds to countdown for the alarm to start ringing. However, a draw back is that it will not work if you close the
application. You need to at least keep it minimized for it to work. It is multiplatform, and works on all desktop
based operating systems that Java supports. You can generate a jar, or use the one provided in the `dist/` directory. 
I recommend you strongly to use Java 8 to run this application. This application is tested for Java8u60 update.
